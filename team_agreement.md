# 401 Python Midterm Team Agreement

**Team Members:** Brannon Starnes, Jordan Folk, Joseph Streifel

---

## Cooperation Plan

### What are the key strengths of each person on the team?

Brannon - Experience in managing groups to a higher morale while working, comfortable giving and taking task based criticisms, ease of blending into new teams for effective work

Joseph - Strong in writing logic/algorithms

Jordan - Confident with back-end work and Python in general as a language.

### How can you best utilize these strengths in the execution of your project?

Our team has varied backgrounds in different styles of projects. With a general team-wide baseline comfort in Python, we should be able to distribute tasks evenly. Our team is also familiar with each other, having worked together in various settings in the past.

### In which professional competencies do you each want to develop greater strength?

Brannon Starnes - Handling ambiguity
Joseph Streifel - Prioritization, planning and estimation
Jordan Folk - Creativity and thinking outside the box

### Knowing that every person in your team needs to understand all aspects of the project, how do you plan to approach the day-to-day work?

We have stand up meetings with the instructor to get on the same page and our team has established a slack group together to openly share info at any hour. Additionally, a mid-day check up around lunch time to adjust the group's course based on what is completed prior to the mid-day meeting.

## Conflict Plan

If a conflict arises, we will try to resolve it at the lowest level possible. Being a team of 3 people, we can probably use the third person as a mediator in conflict between two people. If the conflict is larger, we will grab the instructor for mediation.

If contribution from a team  member is lacking, we will discuss it in a daily standup, and tactfully air any grievances as necessary.

Blockers can be discussed in meetings and addressed as a team when needed.

## Communication Plan

### What hours will you be available to communicate?

9am-6pm for all team members. Communication outside these hours will be limited to slack, and immediate response will not be expected.

### What platforms will you use to communicate (ie. Slack, phone …)?

Slack, Remo, and Zoom

### How often will you take breaks?

Either a 50/10 split per hour or a 90/15 split on and off to step away from the work and reset through the day

### What is your plan if you start to fall behind?

If we reach a 'point of no return' on the backlog, we plan to adjust our MVP to fit what the team is capable of in the timeframe. Remaining flexible on our MVP will be critical to accomplishing the project.

### How will you communicate after hours and on the weekend?

Slack group chat.

### What is your strategy for ensuring everyone’s voice is heard?

Each presented question is asked to each group member and we have been voting on a winning idea instead of just rolling with the first idea that is presented.

### How will you ensure that you are creating a safe environment where everyone feels comfortable speaking up?

Genuine feedback and discussing the suggestions with the group. We want to avoid members feeling like they are tossing ideas into the void.

## Work Plan

### How you will identify tasks, assign tasks, know when they are complete, and manage work in general?

Morning and mid-day meetings for day to day activities and Trello's built in task management

### What project management tool will be used?

Trello!
